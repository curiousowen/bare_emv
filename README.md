# bare_emv
A tool for decoding EMV TLV data, designed to aid researchers and developers in understanding and interpreting EMV structures

The EMV Decoder Tool is a Python-based utility designed to decode EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) TLV (Tag-Length-Value) data structures. This tool provides a starting point for researchers and developers working with EMV data, facilitating the interpretation and understanding of the encoded information commonly used in smart card payment systems.
Features

    Hexadecimal Validation: Ensures the input data is valid hexadecimal.
    TLV Parsing: Parses TLV formatted data into a structured dictionary.
    Hex to ASCII Decoding: Converts hexadecimal values to readable ASCII format.
    User-Friendly Output: Displays decoded data in a clear and organized manner.
    Extensible Design: Allows for easy addition of new EMV tags and functionalities.

Usage
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    hexdump library

Code Overview
EMVDecoder Class

    TAGS: Dictionary containing known EMV tags and their descriptions.
    validate_hex(data: str) -> bool: Validates if the input string is a valid hexadecimal string.
    parse_tlv(data: str): Parses the TLV encoded data into a dictionary.
    decode_hex(hex_data: str) -> str: Decodes hex data to ASCII.
    decode_emv_data(hex_data: str): Main method to decode EMV data from a hex string.
    pretty_print(decoded_data: dict): Prints the decoded EMV data in a user-friendly format.

Contribution

This tool is intended as a starting point for developing more comprehensive and advanced EMV decoding utilities. Researchers and developers are encouraged to expand and enhance this tool by:

    Adding more EMV tags to the TAGS dictionary.
    Implementing support for various encoding schemes.
    Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.

This tool serves as a foundational resource to aid researchers in the creation of better tools and the conduct of more effective research in the field of EMV data analysis.
